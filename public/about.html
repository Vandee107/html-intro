<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Vanessa a.k.a Vandee and i am an aspiring professional basketball player and web developer. I started learning about web development using udemy and i fell in love with Angela Yu.
  I feel the most important part of learning a new skill is with right communication and she puts herself in our shoes and guides us by the hand.
  I have gone this far because of Angela and I know I can go the distance as long as I keep trying./p>

<p>I ama also an avid basketball player and my dream is to go pro and represent my country in the Olypmpics and Afrobasket.
  Sports has been a huge part of my life and it's what I love doing. I know that with God by my side, I can do anything and I will STAY HUNGRY and keep pushing for my dreams so stay tune for more! 
</p>

<p>I will keep updating this website with different things mostly about sports, well being, anime, comics and so much more.
  Just like Angela would say "For all of that and more, see you next time"
